1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

+ when working together in a team
+ assuring backup files are in place


2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

+ prevent working on local changes that could be accidently overwritten by GitHub


3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork --> clone a repository on the servers of GitHub
clone --> either local or server copy of repository
branch --> part of a repository to separate separate lines of development, i.e. bug-fixes, feature implementation, demo versions etc.


4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

you could fetch a possibly changed code on the server and merge it afterwards to change local branch


5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

harder: keep track of changes made by team members


6. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

already answered, see above
