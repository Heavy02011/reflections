1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

+ when working together in a team
+ assuring backup files are in place


2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

+ prevent working on local changes that could be accidently overwritten by GitHub


3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork --> clone a repository on the servers of GitHub
clone --> either local or server copy of repository
branch --> part of a repository to separate separate lines of development, i.e. bug-fixes, feature implementation, demo versions etc.
